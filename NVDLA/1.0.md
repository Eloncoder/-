# Register Interface
This section describes the register address space and register definitions. For each sub-unit, there are status registers, configuration registers, command registers and profiling registers.

## Ping-pong Synchronization Mechanism
One traditional procedure to program hardware is as follows: first, the CPU configures registers on an engine, then it sets the engine’s “enable” bit, then it waits for the hardware to produce a “done” interrupt, and finally it starts the process over again with a new set of registers. This style of programming model will result in the hardware becoming idle between two consecutive hardware layers, which reduces system efficiency.


In order to hide the CPU’s reprogramming latency, NVDLA introduces the concept of ping-pong register programming for per-hardware-layer registers. For most NVDLA subunits, there are two groups of registers; when the subunit is executing using the configuration from the first register set, the CPU can program the second group in the background, setting the second group’s “enable” bit when it is done. When the hardware has finished processing the layer described by the first register set, it will clear the “enable” bit of the first register set, and then switch to the second group if the second group’s “enable” bit has already been set. (If the second group’s “enable” bit has not yet been set, then the hardware becomes idle until programming is complete.) The process, then, repeats, with the second group becoming the active group, and the first group becoming the “shadow” group to which the CPU writes in the background. This mechanism allows the hardware to switch smoothly between active layers, wasting no cycles for CPU configuration.


Note
Unlike a “shadow register” programming model, values written to the inactive group in the “ping-pong” programming model do not get copied to a primary group on activation. As such, the CPU should make sure that all registers in a group have been programmed before enabling the hardware layer to run.


The NVDLA core is built as a series of pipeline stages; each stage is used to handle hardware layers in whole or in part. These pipeline stages are:

* CDMA (convolution DMA)

* CBUF (convolution buffer)

* CSC (convolution sequence controller)

* CMAC (convolution MAC array)

* CACC (convolution accumulator)

* SDP (single data processor)

* SDP_RDMA (single data processor, read DMA)

* PDP (planar data processor)

* PDP_RDMA (planar data processor, read DMA)

* CDP (channel data processor)

* CDP_RDMA (channel data processor, read DMA)

* BDMA (bridge DMA)

* RUBIK (reshape engine)

The first five pipeline stages are part of the convolution core pipeline; all of these pipeline stages (except for CBUF and CMAC) use linked ping-pong buffers in order to work together to form HW layers.
